## Objective

For this assignment you are going to implement multiple sorting algorithms we have covered in 
the class. All the sorting algorithms are going to receive a std::vector<int> reference  if you are
using c++ or an array equivalent data structure if you are using another language.You can add
any extra input you think that is necessary. Your sorting functions should return void and update
the received reference with the sorted version.  All of your sorting functions need to be in one
file. Here is the list of sorting algorithms you need to implement:
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort
* Heapsort
* Merge sort
* Quick sort
* Radix sort
* Bucket sort
Each sorting algorithm is going to be worth 20 points and they are going to be tested with a 
vector that contains 1M integers between 0 and 100k. 

## Where to find stuff
* For Sorting functions implementations check lib.cpp
* For code examples of the Sorting functions check main.cpp
* For unit tests check tests.cpp

## Makefile functions
### Run program
`Make run`

### Run unit tests
`Make tests`
